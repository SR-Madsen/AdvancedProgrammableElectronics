-- QLink stand for Quick-Link and is meant as a tool for students and researchers, to quickly and easily create a
-- link between a UART enabled computer/microcontroller/processor (CPU) and an FPGA, for study and research projects
-- Using a simple text oriented protocol carried by a UART, the CPU can generate read- and write-cycles on a data-bus
-- inside the FPGA.
--
-- History:  QLink is inspired by "Unity-Link" by Anders Lange, which is more comprehensible but is harder for students to use.

--           Unity-Link was inspired by "TOSNet" and "Micro TOSNet by Simon Falsig

-- Use:      QLinkMaster Version XC7 operate as a combined System Control module and System Communication module.
--           The user must use the clock and reset signals provided by QLinkMaster as system clock and system reset. QLinkMaster: 
--             . Generates a combined bitrate- and system-clock of 48MHz from a provided clock signal (external oscillator min 15.625MHz)
--             . Generates a system reset signal synchronized with the system clock. Reset is asserted while:
--                 The Xilinx Clock Managemant Module (MMCM) is locking on the the clock after power-up
--                 OR the reset input is asserted  
--           QLinkMaster operate at 3Mbps 8N1 with no handshake and no echoing.
--           When operating it accept the following commands issued through Tx:
--             #:wAADDDDDDDD   - Where AA is a 2-digit base 16 address, eg: 04 and DDDDDDDD is an 8-digit base 16 data word
--                               The FPGA create an internal write cycle but does not send anything in return on Rx
--             #:rAA.......... - Where AA is a 2-digit base 16 address and .......... are 10 arbitrary non "#" characters for padding
--                               The FPGA create an internal read-cycle and respond on Rx with: "!AA:DDDDDDDD
--                               Where AA is the read address and DDDDDDDD is an 8-digit base 16 representation of the data read
--             #:RAA.................... - With 20 arbitrary non "#" characters for padding
--                               The FPGA create an internal read-cycle and read the internal 32-bit clock cycle counter and
--                               respond with: !AA:DDDDDDDD;CCCCCCCC where CCCCCCCC is an 8-digit base 16 representation of the clock counter
--                               The padding in #r/#R commands ensure proper spacing between commands to allow the fpga to respond,
--                               The padding is not necessary if similar pauses between commands is ensured in another way.
--                               Characters not in the set: "#:rRwW0123456789abcdefABCDEF" are treated as spacing 
--
----------------------
-- Demo:    In this demo application, QLINK is instantiated and connected to a very simple state machine (SM)
--          The SM maintain an 8 bit register, routed to 8 outputs (LEDS) allowing the user to monitor the register state
--
--          Upon RESET, the LED register is set to "01010101"
--
--          In read cycles, the SM return a 32-bit value of: Prefix: X"FF0aa0" combined with the 8-bit address of the read cycle
--          allowing the PC host to verify that the address was received properly by QLINK
--          Also, the LED register will be set to the value of the address for manual verification
--
--          In write cycles, the SM will copy the 8 MSB of the received 32 bits data to the LED register
